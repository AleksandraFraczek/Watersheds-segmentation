# Watersheds-segmentation
The aim of the project was to create binary masks of water surfaces using the U-Net network trained on the images satellite.Creating a model that will segment the elements (water surfaces), such as: rivers, lakes, seas, oceans, lagoons, water reservoirs, retention reservoirs on satellite images. The model should separate the water surface from the rest of the image by separating the water areas in white, a the remaining areas in black. This was a group project.
